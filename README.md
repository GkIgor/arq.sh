# arq.sh
script created in bash
Run the code using arq.sh DDMMYY being:
DD: Previous Day;
MM: Month (If day 01, previous month);
YY (last two digits of the year).

Rename it to arq and add it to your /usr/bin to run from anywhere in linux.
Created with the intention of automating a commonly worked task, mainly for co-workers.
The code was created with checks for a certain company. These checks serve to fetch the parameters for the functions.
Due to company secrecy and my respect for the company, parts of the code have been changed.
